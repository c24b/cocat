CoCat is a generator for a collaborative and dynamic cataloging system.
You can build any kind of catalog out of the box: 
- exposing your catalog to the public like a simple CMS
- enabling comments and suggestions
Cocat adresses the catalog managing process issues:
throught an upcoming web interface (now just an API) you can
- udpate the metadata schema of the catalog (with your data synchronized)
- update/modify vocabularies and standards, define specificy vocabularies collaboratively 
- managing the search engine and filters capabilities
- automatically translate data and metadata
