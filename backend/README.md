CoCat is a tool to create a collaborative and dynamic cataloging system out of the box.

You can build any kind of catalog out of the box: 
by simply defining your metadata schema 


Cocat works as a simple CMS
- exposing your catalog to the public
- enabling comments and suggestions from users
- defining administrator and experts roles and permissions
  
But Cocat aims to address the catalog managing process issues:
- udpate the metadata schema of the catalog (with your data synchronized)
- update/modify vocabularies and standards (with your data synchronized)
- define specific vocabularies collaboratively 
- managing the search engine and filters capabilities
- managing the display of your metadata
- managing the export in EU and Worlds standards (DCAT-AP, JsonSchema, INSPIRE, XML, SemanticWeb)
- automatically translate data and metadata
